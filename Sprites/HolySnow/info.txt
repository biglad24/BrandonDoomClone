Description: Evil spreads far and wide, from the scorching sands in the east to
the frozen lands of the north. Though the frozen lands are harsh enough to stop
most creatures, some are resilient enough to endure the frozen wastes. To combat
these evils the frost mages developed a new magic that infuses holy energies
into the snow that naturally falls from the sky. Though not terribly strong this
Holy Snow slowly drains the health of evil creatures. Calling upon the holy
energies requires reciting the spell, 'Sanctus Nix, conjectus auferetur malum!'
